Raniery's To Do List

It is a simple application developed using the React library. It aims to help the user to keep a simple, well designed to do list.

It allows the user to both add and remove tasks at "their" own will. Every input, after submited, is displayed on the screen. Also, the app has a counter, which assists the user in terms of keeping track of the amount of tasks "they" has. 

It implements a connection with local storage, so the user does not lose the tasks he entered, even if he closes the program tab. 

Coding this app I could improve my skills in Javascript as well as expand my knowledge in React. It was good to explore and learn more about how the connection between components works.

To costumize it is very easy. It just need to change a few lines of code, especifically the title ones.
